\chapter{A slice of theory and logical}

Let's move on to the logical side now.

\section{OpenPGP, how does it work ?}\label{openpgp-how-does-it-work}

OpenPGP uses asymmetric cryptography, also called public-key cryptography. When talking about GPG keys, we actually talk about couples of keys : a public, and a private key.

\section{Does it have to be that complicated ?}\label{does-it-have-to-be-that-complicated}

When you sign a mail, you want to insure your pen pal that it's truthful. Same as seals in the Middle-Age : the seal's wax warranted
message's inviolability.\\
\\
You have to sign your message with something you're the only one to
possess : your \textbf{\emph{private}} key !\\
\\
And how do your pen pals would check this message is authentic ? With something that is well-known, available to anyone : checking signatures
is done with your \textbf{\emph{public}} key !\\
\\
Opposite, when one encrypt (or cipher) a message, one wants to protect it. You are the only one who should be able to read it with something
you are the only one to possess : your \textbf{\emph{private}} key !\\
\\
But as anyone should be able to send you encrypted mails, the ciphering operation should be done with something available to anyone : your
\textbf{\emph{public}} key !

\section{Be cautious !}\label{be-cautious}

A signed mail \textbf{can be read by anybody online}. Just like a random mail actually. The signature warrant that you are the true sender and that it has not been altered. So a signed mail has more juridical value than a
non-signed mail.

\section{Summary}\label{summary}

We sign mail with \emph{private} key. We check signed mail with the sender's \emph{public} key.\\
\\
We encrypt mails with the recipient \emph{public} key, and they decrypt with their \emph{private} key.\\
\\
It's always the same side of the liaison that uses the same side of the key: you will always (or almost) use your private key, and your pals
will always use your public key.\\
\\
Your private key should be protected like Precious\ldots{}

It allows you to control your side of the liaison, to prove your identity and read your mail !
