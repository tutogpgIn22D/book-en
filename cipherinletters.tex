	\chapter{Preamble}
	
	This document uses my texts from my GPG-Howto or tutorial. It is the \textit{short} version, with the functions that I think are the most important in GnuPG and OpenPG.
	
	This How-to can be read on my website\footnote{english version: \url{http://www.22decembre.eu/category/howto-gpg.html}}. I wish you read, share and reshare this work, online (html) or off-line (this pdf).
	
	Of course, the texts have been slightly modified to correspond to their current form: a mini-book. But I kept the exercises from the blog articles.
	
	The aim of this document is to push internet users, so actually some big pat of the occidental population, to protect their communications in the form of mails and instant messaging.
	
	As I am writing this book, some laws, extremely dangerous for privacy and public liberties, are being voted or adopted by several european countries. I think obviously of France, but also UK or Switzerland !
	
	This pdf file has been signed by my gpg key and the tutorial's one. Those two keys have been included in the pdf itself.
	
	Here are their fingerprints:
